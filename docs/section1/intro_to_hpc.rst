Introduction to HPC
===================

High Peformance Computing (HPC) refers to the aggregation of computing resources (i.e.
supercomputers or clusters) to achieve performance far greater than a single workstation or server.
By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Describe basic HPC architecture
* Log in to a remote HPC system at TACC
* Navigate the TACC file systems
* Transfer files to and from TACC systems


Basic HPC System Architecture
-----------------------------

As you prepare to use TACC systems for this workshop, it is important to understand the basic
architecture. We can think of an HPC system as a very large and complicated laboratory instrument.
Users need to learn how to:

* Interface with it / push the right buttons (Linux)
* Load samples (transfer data)
* Run experiments (submit batch jobs)
* Interpret the results (perform data analysis / vis)

**IMPORTANT: Login vs. Compute Nodes**

An HPC system has login nodes and compute nodes. We cannot run applications on the **login nodes**
because they require too many resources and will interrupt the work of others. Instead, we must
submit a job to a queue to run on **compute nodes**.

Authentication 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To log in to TACC systems and participate in this workshop, you will need a TACC account and must
have set up multi-factor authentication using a token app or SMS.  You can do this by visiting the
`TACC portal <https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/login>`_:

.. image:: ./images/TACC_login.png
   :target: ./images/TACC_login.png
   :alt: TACC login page
   :width: 400px
   :align: center

|

Then clicking on your username at the top right of the page:

.. image:: ./images/TACC_dashboard.png
   :target: ./images/TACC_dashboard.png
   :alt: TACC Dashboard
   :width: 800px
   :align: center

A Note About Quotas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The welcome message you receive upon successful login to Frontera has useful information
for you to keep track of. Especially of note is the breakdown of disk quotas for your account,
as you can keep an eye on whether your usage is nearing the determined limit. 

Once your usage is nearing the quota, you'll start to experience issues that will not only
impact your own work, but also impact the system for others. For example, if you're nearing
your quota in ``$WORK``, and your job is repeatedly trying (and failing) to write to ``$WORK``,
you will stress that file system.

.. tip::

   Another useful way to monitor your disk quotas (and TACC project balances) at any time is to
   execute:
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
      [frontera]$ /usr/local/etc/taccinfo


Data Management
---------------

Creating and Changing Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a Windows or Mac desktop, our present location determines what files and folders we can access. I
can "see" my present location visually with the help of the graphic interface - I could be looking
at my Desktop, or the contents of a folder, for example. In a Linux command-line interface, we lack
the same visual cues to tell us what our location is. Instead, we use a command - ``pwd`` (print
working directory) - to tell us our present location. Try executing this command on Frontera:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ pwd
   /home1/03302/lconcia

This home location on the Linux filesystem is unique for each user, and it is roughly analogous to
C:\\Users\\username on Windows, or /Users/username on Mac.

To see what files and folders are available at this location, use the ``ls`` (list) command:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ ls

I have no files or folders in my home directory yet, so I do not get a response. We can create some
folders using the ``mkdir`` (make directory) command. The words  'folder' and 'directory' are
interchangeable:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ mkdir folder1
   [frontera]$ mkdir folder2

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ ls
   folder1 folder2

Now we have some folders to work with. To "open" a folder, navigate into that folder using the
``cd`` (change directory) command. This process is analogous to double-clicking a folder on Windows
or Mac:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ pwd
   /home1/03302/lconcia
   [frontera]$ cd folder1
   [frontera]$ pwd
   /home1/03302/lconcia/folder1

Use ``ls`` to list the contents. What do you expect to see?

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ ls

There is nothing there because we have not made anything yet. Next, we will navigate back to the 
home directory. So far we have seen how to navigate "down" into folders, but how do we navigate 
back "up" to the parent folder? There are different ways to do it. For example, we could use a
shortcut, ``..``,  which refers to the **parent folder** - one level higher than the current
location:

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ cd ..
   [frontera]$ pwd
   /home1/03302/lconcia

We are back in our home directory. Instead, we could specify the complete path of where we want to
go, in this case ``cd /home1/03302/lconcia``. Finally, let's remove the directories we have made,
using ``rmdir`` to remove our folder ``folder1`` and any contents. The ``-r`` command line
option recursively removes subfolders and files located "down" the parent directory. ``-r`` is
required for folders.

.. code-block:: console

   [frontera]$ rm -r folder1
   [frontera]$ ls 
   folder2


Transferring Files to and from Frontera
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To practice transferring files to Frontera's ``$WORK`` and ``$SCRATCH``, we need to identify the 
path to our ``$WORK`` and ``$SCRATCH`` directory.  To identify these paths, we can use helpful
command shortcuts.

To identify the path to our ``$WORK`` directory, we can use ``cd $WORK`` or the helpful shortcut
``cdw``:

.. code-block:: console
   
   [frontera]$ cdw
   [frontera]$ pwd
   /work2/03302/lconcia/frontera

To identify the path to our ``$SCRATCH`` directory, we can use ``cd $SCRATCH`` or the helpful
shortcut ``cds``:

.. code-block:: console
   
   [frontera]$ cds
   [frontera]$ pwd
   /scratch1/03302/lconcia

Copying files from your local computer to Frontera's ``$WORK`` requires the ``scp`` command. This
should be available in your local Terminal (Mac/Linux) or WSL2 (Windows):

.. code-block:: console

   [local]$ scp my_file lconcia@frontera.tacc.utexas.edu:/work2/03302/lconcia/frontera
   (enter password)
   (enter token)

In this command, you specify the name of the file you want to transfer (``my_file``), the username
(``lconcia``), the hostname (``frontera.tacc.utexas.edu``), and the path you want to put the file
(``/work2/03302/lconcia/frontera``). Take careful notice of the separators including spaces, the @
symbol, and the colon. 

Copying files from your local computer **to** Frontera's ``$SCRATCH`` using ``scp``:

.. code-block:: console

   [local]$ scp my_file lconcia@frontera.tacc.utexas.edu:/scratch1/03302/lconcia/frontera
   (enter password)
   (enter token)

Copy files **from** Frontera to your local computer using the following:

.. code-block:: console

   [local]$ scp lconcia@frontera.tacc.utexas.edu:/work2/03302/lconcia/frontera/my_file ./
   (enter password)
   (enter token)

.. note::

   If you wanted to copy ``my_file`` from ``$SCRATCH``, the path you would specify after the
   colon would be ``/scratch1/03302/lconcia/frontera/my_file``.

Instead of files, full directories can be copied using the "recursive" flag (``scp -r ...``). See
additional example ``scp`` usage `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy>`__.
